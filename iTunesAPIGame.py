# Part 1.1: Search for music on the iTunes API
# Fetches a list of songs from the iTunes API (https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/). iTunesSearch returns a list of results from the iTunes API. It is limited to only include music tracks.

def iTunesSearch(searchTerm):

# Part 1.2: Get a list of songs
# Indefinitely asks user for search terms (e.g., artist names, track names, etc.). For every search term the user enters, the results from the iTunes API (part 1.1) are added to a list that tracks all the results. The program asks the user for search terms until they enter 'stop'.

# Part 2.1: Pick a random song
# After creating a list of songs (part 1), the program picks a song at random from that list.

# Part 2.2: Play a song preview
# After picking a random song (2.1), the program plays an audio preview of the song by importing a few features from the IPython.display module. The program then generates a URL for an audio file.

# Part 2.3: Print a "blanked out" version of the song
# After picking a random song (2.1) and playing a song preview (2.2), the code replaces every alphanumeric character (a-z, 0-9) in the track name with an underscore ('_').

# Part 2.4: Allow the user to guess the track name (or pass)
# After the program picks a random song (2.1), plays the song preview (2.2), and prints a "blanked out" version of the song (2.3), it repeatedly asks the user to guess the song. Each time, it does the following:
# - Asks the user to enter a guess (using input()).
# - If the user guesses the correct track name, print "You got it!".
# - If the user guesses incorrectly, print "It's not '<what the user entered>'".
# - If the user enters 'pass' then the correct answer is displayed ("The song was '<track name>'") and stops asking for guesses.
# This is not run to be case sensitive.

# Part 2.5: Indefinite roundsÂ¶
# The program repeats parts 2.1-2.4 indefinitely (until the user types 'exit'). 

# Part 3: (Lines 77-108 and marked extraneous lines): Hints and counting runs
#  If the user doesn't answer correctly in three tries, they will be prompted with a hint. If they accept the hint, they will see it and continue back to guessing. If they deny the hint, they will be forced to keep guessing and will be prompted after another three guesses. This process will repeat for a second hint. The first hint is to reveal album artwork. The second hint is to reveal the name of the artist. I also included termination commands by typing '==exit==' in all the input prompts for the admin to terminate the game if necessary (without using 'interupt the kernel' in the code window). I also wrote whileLoopRunCount to track whether the user is inputing 'done calling terms' when there are no terms desired, preventing the script from erroring with terms counted for 'done calling terms'.
