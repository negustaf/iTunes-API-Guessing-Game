# iTunes-API-Guessing-Game
Single-player game that uses the iTunes API and plays a song for the user to listen to and guess by offering various hints like album artwork and artist name.

No code will be printable without the imported files form Jupiter Notebook. This file is purely for record of code. Sorry you can't play the game. It was a fun one :/
