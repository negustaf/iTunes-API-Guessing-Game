# iTunes-API-Guessing-Game
Single-player game that uses the iTunes API to play a song for the user to listen to and guess the track name. The program offers various hints by pulling the album artwork and artist name after X guesses.

**Notice:** No code will be printable without the imported files form my deleted Jupiter Notebook. Sorry you can't play the game. It was a fun one :/
